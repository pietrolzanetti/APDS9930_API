# APDS9930_API

## Introduction
This API was developed as a work in the discipline of Embedded Systems Programming at UFMG - Prof. Ricardo de Oliveira Duarte - Department of Electronic EngineeringLibrary is 
developed and tested with STM32F1xx (Nucleo 64 board). 

The main.c file contain exemples of usage based in Bare Metal programming. Therefore, the functions used in the exemple are executated by the hardware when the interruption caused by the peripherals is enabled for CPU service. When not executing the instructions of the function, CPU will be executing the infinite loop.

## Hardware requirements
* STM32F41xx microntroller;
* APDS-9930 ALS IR RGB and Gesture Sensor Proximity Sensor;
* 0.96 Inch Yellow and Blue I2C IIC Serial 128X64 OLED Display;

## Connections

## API usage
1. Download APDS9930.c from the APDS9930_API/Core/Src and APDS9930.h from the APDS_API/Core/Inc 
directory;
2. Copy APDS9930.h to your projec's Inc directory and the APDS9930.c to your projec's Src directory;
3. Include where you expect to use.

## API functions
```C
bool APDS9930_Init();
```
 Define initialization values.
 
 
 ```C
 bool APDS9930_WriteRegData(uint8_t reg, uint8_t data);
 ```

```C
void interrup_treat();
```
Begin interrupt treatment and define cause of interruption.


```C
void Prox_treat(uint16_t data);
```
Triggered by proximity sensor interrupt. Define which threshold was passed.

Parameters:
  * ```data```: ;


```C
bool clear_INT();
```
Interrupt clear.
